- Optimization suggestions with potential savings calculations
- Fleet utilization analysis and vehicle assignment recommendations
- Driver performance metrics and comparative analysis

### üîÆ Predictive Maintenance Service
```csharp
// Get predictive maintenance schedule
var maintenance = new PredictiveMaintenanceService();
var predictions = await maintenance.GetMaintenancePredictionsAsync(vehicleId);

// Calculate vehicle health score
var healthScore = await maintenance.CalculateVehicleHealthScoreAsync(vehicleId);

// Get priority alerts
var alerts = await maintenance.GetMaintenanceAlertsAsync();
```

**Key Features:**
- Predictive maintenance scheduling based on mileage, time, and usage patterns
- Vehicle health scoring with component-level analysis

// Check for driver schedule conflicts
var conflicts = await validator.CheckDriverScheduleConflictsAsync(driverId, date);
```

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- Auto-fix capabilities with confidence scoring
- Schedule conflict analysis across routes and activities
- Enhanced user experience with actionable validation messages

### üéØ Demo & Testing
Try out the new features using the analytics demo form:
```csharp
var demoForm = new AnalyticsDemoForm();
demoForm.ShowDialog();
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- SQLite (embedded) or SQL Server (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wiley-Consolidated-School/BusBuddyFinal-Github.git
   cd BusBuddyFinal-Github
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Setup

### SQL Server Express Setup
BusBuddy requires SQL Server Express for data storage. Follow these steps:

1. **Install SQL Server Express**:
   - Download from [Microsoft SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
   - Install with default settings
   - Note your server instance name (e.g., `ST-LPTP9-23\SQLEXPRESS01`)

2. **Configure Connection**:
   ```xml
   <!-- App.config -->
   <connectionStrings>
     <add name="DefaultConnection"
          connectionString="Server=YOUR_SERVER\SQLEXPRESS01;Database=BusBuddy;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
          providerName="Microsoft.Data.SqlClient" />
   </connectionStrings>
   ```

3. **Create Database**:
   ```sql
   -- Connect to SQL Server Express
   sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER\SQLEXPRESS01 -Q "CREATE DATABASE BusBuddy;"

   -- Run database scripts
   sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER\SQLEXPRESS01 -d BusBuddy -i "BusBuddy.Data\DatabaseScript.SqlServer.sql"
   sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER\SQLEXPRESS01 -d BusBuddy -i "BusBuddy.Data\TestSeedData.sql"
   ```

### üíæ Database Backup and Restore

**Backup Database**:
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE BusBuddy TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\BusBuddy.bak'
WITH FORMAT, INIT, NAME = 'BusBuddy-Full Database Backup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, STATS = 10;
```

**Restore Database**:
```sql
RESTORE DATABASE BusBuddy FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\BusBuddy.bak'
WITH REPLACE, STATS = 10;
```

**Automated Backup Script**:
```powershell
# backup-database.ps1
$backupPath = "C:\Backups\BusBuddy_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss').bak"
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER\SQLEXPRESS01 -Q "BACKUP DATABASE BusBuddy TO DISK = '$backupPath'"
```

## üìä Cost Analytics Usage

The cost analytics system provides real-time insights into transportation costs:

**Route Cost Analysis** (Expected values for June 2025):
- Regular Routes: ~$2.70 per student per day
- Sports/Activities: ~$5.67 per student per day
- Special Events: Varies based on distance and group size

**Usage Examples**:
```csharp
// Get monthly cost breakdown
var analytics = new RouteAnalyticsService();
var costs = await analytics.CalculateCostPerStudentMetricsAsync(
    DateTime.Now.AddDays(-30),
    DateTime.Now
);

Console.WriteLine($"Route Cost/Student/Day: ${costs.RouteCostPerStudentPerDay:F2}");
Console.WriteLine($"Sports Cost/Student/Day: ${costs.SportsCostPerStudentPerDay:F2}");
```
