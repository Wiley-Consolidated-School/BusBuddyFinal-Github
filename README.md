// Get priority alerts
var alerts = await maintenance.GetMaintenanceAlertsAsync();
```

**Key Features:**
- Predictive maintenance scheduling based on mileage, time, and usage patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

```
BusBuddy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BusBuddy.UI/          # Windows Forms user interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BusBuddy.Business/    # Business logic and services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BusBuddy.Data/        # Data access layer and repositories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BusBuddy.Models/      # Domain models and entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BusBuddy.Tests/       # Unit and integration tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Db/                   # Database initialization and scripts
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- SQLite (embedded) or SQL Server (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wiley-Consolidated-School/BusBuddyFinal-Github.git
   cd BusBuddyFinal-Github
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore BusBuddy.sln
   ```

3. **Build the solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet build BusBuddy.sln --configuration Release
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project . --configuration Release
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### SQLite (Default)
- The app uses SQLite by default. No setup required; the database file will be created automatically.

### SQL Server (Optional)
1. Start a SQL Server instance (local or Docker):
   ```pwsh
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong@Passw0rd" -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```
2. Run the setup script to initialize the database:
   ```pwsh
   cd Db
   ./setup.ps1 -SqlServer localhost -User sa -Password YourStrong@Passw0rd -Script setup.sql
   ```
3. In `BusBuddy.Tests/App.config`, comment out the SQLite connection string and uncomment the SQL Server one.

### Schema & ERD
- See [`Db/SCHEMA.md`](Db/SCHEMA.md) for a full schema reference.
- (ER diagram: `Db/ERD.png` to be added)

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure SQL Server is running and accessible.
- For Docker, use `localhost,1433` as the server.
- If you see connection errors, check firewall and authentication settings.

## üß™ Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
dotnet test BusBuddy.sln --configuration Release
```

### Run Tests with Local Coverage Analysis
```powershell
# Easy one-click coverage (recommended for single developer)
.\run-coverage-local.ps1
```

This will:
- Run all tests with coverage collection
- Generate HTML coverage report
- Automatically open the report in your browser
- Show detailed line-by-line coverage analysis

### Manual Coverage Commands
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test BusBuddy.sln --configuration Release --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory TestResults

# Install ReportGenerator (one time)
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

# Generate HTML report
reportgenerator -reports:"TestResults\**\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"TestResults\CoverageReport" -reporttypes:Html
```

### Current Test Status
- **19 tests passing**, 1 skipped (SQL Server test)
- **Coverage focus**: Core business logic and data access layers
- **Test categories**: Unit tests, integration tests, database tests

### Current Test Status
- ‚úÖ **19 tests passing**
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **1 test skipped** (SQL Server integration - requires database instance)

- ‚úÖ **Test execution** with results reporting
- ‚úÖ **Code coverage** analysis via Codecov
- ‚úÖ **Deployment artifacts** for releases

### Code Coverage
We use Codecov to track test coverage and maintain code quality:

- **Coverage reports** generated on every CI run
- **PR comments** with coverage changes
- **Coverage trends** tracked over time
- **Quality gates** ensure coverage standards

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure

- **Models**: Data entities representing vehicles, drivers, routes, etc.
- **Repositories**: Data access layer with interface-based design
- **Services**: Business logic and domain operations
- **Forms**: Windows Forms UI for user interaction

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Standards

- Follow C# coding conventions
- Maintain test coverage above 70%
- All tests must pass before merging
- Use meaningful commit messages

### Code Formatting

- Run `dotnet format BusBuddy.sln` to format code according to project standards
- Verify formatting with `dotnet format BusBuddy.sln --verify-no-changes`
- CI pipeline will enforce code formatting standards

### Pre-Commit Screening

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

1. **Install pre-commit**:
   ```
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. **Install the hook**:
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Update pre-commit config**:
   ```
   pre-commit migrate-config
   ```

3. **Pre-commit checks include**:
   - Code formatting verification
   - Unit tests execution
   - Test coverage (70%+ threshold)
   - Code secrets detection

4. **Fix common issues**:
   - Formatting: `dotnet format BusBuddy.sln`
   - Tests: Fix failing tests in BusBuddy.Tests
   - Coverage: Add more unit tests to increase coverage
   - Secrets: Move sensitive data to secure storage

## üìà Monitoring & Reporting

- **Build Status**: ![Build Status](https://github.com/Wiley-Consolidated-School/BusBuddyFinal-Github/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)
- **Code Coverage**: [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Wiley-Consolidated-School/BusBuddyFinal-Github/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Wiley-Consolidated-School/BusBuddyFinal-Github)
- **Test Results**: Available in GitHub Actions runs

## üßπ Repository Maintenance

### Cleanup and Housekeeping
Run the cleanup script regularly to maintain repository health:

```powershell
# General cleanup
.\cleanup-repository.ps1

# Fix trailing whitespace (preview changes)
.\fix-whitespace.ps1 -WhatIf

# Fix trailing whitespace (apply changes)
.\fix-whitespace.ps1
```

This script removes:
- Build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`, `TestResults/`)
- Temporary files (`*.tmp`, `*.bak`, `*_new.*`, etc.)
- Backup directories (`Migration_Backups/`, etc.)
- Empty directories
- Untracked git files
- Reports trailing whitespace issues

### File Management Best Practices
- Remove temporary files (`.new`, `.bak`, `.backup`) after use
- Clean up migration backups after successful migrations
- Use `.gitignore` to prevent tracking build artifacts
- Monitor repository size with `git count-objects -vH`
- **Remove trailing whitespace** from all source files
- Ensure files end with exactly one newline character
