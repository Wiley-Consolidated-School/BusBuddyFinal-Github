## Configuration

### Current Setup
The application uses a configuration-based licensing system:

1. **Configuration File**: `syncfusion-license.json`
   ```json
   {
     "SyncfusionLicense": {
       "LicenseKey": "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE",
       "LicenseType": "Community",
       "Status": "Pending Approval"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Helper Class**: `SyncfusionLicenseHelper.cs`
   - Handles license registration with error handling
   - Reads from configuration file
   - Provides fallback licensing

3. **Program.cs Integration**
   - Automatically registers license at startup
   - Provides clear console feedback

### Updating Your License
When you receive your community license:

1. Open `syncfusion-license.json`
2. Replace the `LicenseKey` value with your approved license
3. Update the `Status` to "Approved"
4. Restart the application

## Troubleshooting

### License Key Errors
If you see license-related errors or watermarks:

1. **Check Console Output**: Look for licensing messages at startup
2. **Verify License Key**: Ensure it's properly formatted in the config file
3. **Check Qualification**: Ensure you meet community license requirements
4. **Contact Support**: If approved license still shows errors

### Common Error Messages
- `"Invalid license key"` - License key format is incorrect
- `"License expired"` - Trial period has ended, need valid license
- Watermarks in UI - Using trial version or invalid license

### Immediate Solutions
