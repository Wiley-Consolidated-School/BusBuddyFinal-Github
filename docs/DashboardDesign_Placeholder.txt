# This is a text placeholder for a PNG file

Due to the nature of the VS Code interface, we can't directly create a PNG image file through this text interface. In a real-world scenario, you would:

1. Use a graphic design tool like Figma, Adobe XD, or even PowerPoint to create the dashboard design
2. Export the design as a PNG file
3. Save it to the docs/DashboardDesign.png path

The design should include these elements as specified in DASHBOARD_DESIGN_PNG_NOTE.md:

1. Header Section:
   - BusBuddy Transportation Dashboard title
   - Theme Selector (Office2016Black)
   - Close button

2. Navigation Section (left side):
   - Menu items for different modules
   - Navigation drawer with collapsible panel

3. Main Content Area with tabs:
   - Overview Tab (Analytics Chart and Statistics Gauges)
   - Routes Tab (SfDataGrid with route data)
   - Activities Tab (SfDataGrid with activity schedule)
   - Reports Tab (Report Generation interface)

This file serves as a placeholder to track the requirement for the visual design.
